# SQL-Tableau Data Analysis Project

This project combines SQL data analysis with Tableau visualizations to explore and present insights from a movie database.

## Project Components

### SQL Analysis
- The SQL queries are stored in a PDF file, following Udacity's metric for query documentation.
- The database file can be accessed from the [Sakilla Movie Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atanaskanev/sqlite-sakila-sample-database) on Kaggle.

### Tableau Visualizations
- The Tableau visualizations were created on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ayo.mosaku/viz/MovieDatabaseEDA/Story1) and exported to a PowerPoint presentation.

### PowerPoint Presentation
- The PowerPoint presentation (`finaltableaueda.pptx`) contains a summary of the Tableau visualizations and insights derived from the analysis.

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, you'll need:

- SQL database management system (PostgreSQL)
- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public
- PDF reader
- Microsoft PowerPoint or compatible software

## Usage

1. **SQL Queries**:
   - Open the PDF file containing the SQL queries.
   - Execute the queries in your SQL environment to reproduce the analysis.

2. **Tableau Visualizations**:
   - Open the PPTX file to view or edit the Tableau visualizations.
   - For interactive exploration, access the original Tableau workbook on Tableau Public.

## Project Structure
